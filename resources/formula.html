                    polynomial ax2 + bx + c is −b
                    a

                    degree polynomials as well. For example, if the cubic polynomial ax3 +bx2 +cx+d has roots r, s, t,
                    r + s + t =

                    This essentially states that the root-mean square is greater than or equal to the arithmetic mean
                    is greater than or equal to the geometric mean is greater than or equal to the harmonic mean. The
                    most important part of this inequality is AM-GM, which states that the arithmetic mean is greater
                    than or equal to the geometric mean. Equality holds when all the s are the same. It is often used
                    for maximization and minimization problems. Here is an interesting “proof” for this from AoPS
